<h1>Demonstrating Complex SQL Techniques</h1>
<img width="410" alt="SQL Project 1" src="https://github.com/jciwilliams/SQL_Techniques/assets/152811710/0cd14067-3a89-44f3-84d1-e1396f436c7d">

### SQL projects demonstrate complex skills like: 
 - <b>Retrieving Data using Conditional Comparison Operators for Filtering</b>
 - <b>Extracting Data from a Date and Numbers</b>
 - <b>Retrieving Data from Multiple Tables Using Union and Subqueries</b>
 - <b>Retrieving Data using Case Statements </b>


<h2>SQL Project 1</h2>
The Intake Director just left a strategy meeting with the Chief Health Officer (CHO).
The CHO emphasized an urgent initiative focused on patients residing in California, Montana, and Minnesota, as new state-specific health policy changes will go into effect on November 1, 2025.
To support this initiative, she needs a report that identifies active patients covered under:
-Medicaid in California, or
-Blue Cross–affiliated insurance plans in Montana and Minnesota.
The report will be used to estimate how many patients may be impacted by these upcoming policy changes. The list should show active patients that have Medicaid in CA OR BCBS in MT and MN.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 2</h2>
The Director of Community Health Outreach just met with the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) to plan upcoming patient engagement events in key metropolitan areas across the Southeast.
The marketing team wants to focus on major cities and their surrounding suburbs where outreach campaigns will be launched.
Specifically, they’re targeting patients who reside in or near:
Atlanta, GA, Dallas, TX, Miami, FL, and Greenville, SC
Because many patients live in suburban or directional areas (for example, “North Atlanta,” “South Miami,” “Greenville Heights”), he emphasized that the search should include any record where the city name contains those target city names — not just exact matches.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 3</h2>
A Senior Financial Analyst is working on a mid-year review with the Chief Revenue Officer (CRO).
The CRO has requested a focused audit on mid-range payments (those between $800 and $1,200) from key commercial payers — UHC and Aetna.
The purpose of the audit is to identify consistent payment patterns and ensure these remits are not being reduced by contractual adjustments (CO codes), which could indicate underpayments or misapplied contractual logic. He’s task is to isolate all remittances that meet the following criteria:
The dataset will be reviewed by both the Billing Audit and Contracting teams to evaluate payment consistency before contract renegotiations begin. The list should show mid-range payments between $800 and $1200, payers (UHC and Aetna), and not being reduced by CO codes.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 5</h2>
Auditors are now requesting all claims to be discarded 36 months after the claim deposit date. May you provide auditors with a list of the claim discard date for each claim that we have in our system for non-P04 and P06 providers? The list should show a list of claims, the discard date with 36 months after the deposit date, and Non P04 and P06 providers.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 6</h2>
An analyst is evaluating UnitedHealthcare (UHC) payment patterns to forecast revenue for next year. Management wants to see the average payment amount per year for claims with payer “UHC” with CO and PR pay codes who are on manual payments or UHC with OA pay codes who are on auto payment. The list should show UnitedHealthcare payments and average payment amount per year. Payer claims (UHC) with CO/PR codes and on manual payments OR claims with UHC OA pay codes who are on auto payments.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 7</h2>
For all EDI claim submissions that were submitted with an E primary diagnosis code that took at least 30 days to be adjudicated, we need the provider who submitted these claims as long as the providers have been active with us for at least 5 years. The should show all  claim submission, E primary diagnoses codes, providers names, took at least 30 days to be adjudicated, and providers need to be active with the company for at least 5 years. <br />

<h2>SQL Project 8</h2>
New patients have a 90-day waiting period before certain benefits become active. The Eligibility team needs to determine when each patient’s waiting period ends along with the day of the week for the waiting period end date. The list should show each patient’s waiting period end date with 90 days after they enrolled and day of the week for the waiting period end date.<br />

<h2>SQL Project 9</h2>
For all Endocrinology providers whose NPIs start with 7 or Dermatology providers whose NPIs start with 1 or 2 who have not completed a procedure but have visits recorded, may you let us know how long each of these providers have been active providers with us? The list should show all endocrinology providers, NPIs need to start with 7 OR all dermatology providers, NPIs need to start with 1 or 2, DID NOT complete a procedure, but have visits on records and how long each provider has been active (years).<br />

<h2>SQL Project 10</h2>
Identify all applicants who completed online registration and determine the core attributes required to analyze digital engagement. We need this for applicants who have at least a 750 credit score and reside in the Southwest region OR applicants who are not located in NY, CA, and/or HI. Your output should include: Member ID, First and Last Name, Method of Sign-Up (channel of enrollment), Credit score, and Email address (if they have one on record). Consider how isolating online sign-ups could help the credit union assess digital adoption trends and improve member acquisition strategies.<br />

The Customer Loyalty team is going to $X off in honor of our annual customer appreciation. The discount will be allocated based on the customer tier level for active customers who have been customers for at least 2 years. May you apply the $X off based on the customer’s tier level:
- Standard: $100 off
- Silver: $250 off
- Gold: $500 off

Once you have this, please provide them with the number of customers at each discount level, along with the total expected discounts at each discount level so Finance can properly forecast the burdened cost of these holiday discounts. The list should show active customers, customers for at least 2 years, by tier level, number of customers at each tier/discount level and total expected discounts at each tier /discount level.<br />
